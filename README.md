A Chrome Extension to create a Netflix viewing queue for all your binging desires.

TODO:
Create Extension IU
Make Search parameters
Search for Show/Movie link
Return link
Add to Queue
Add Queue mutability
Incorporate queue into netflix party

Issues:
    When right clicking on the play button, a unique tctx link is generated to continue movie/episode where that specific user left off.
This is completely untransferrable between accounts. On the other hand clicking on individual episodes generates a trackID link which
can be transferred between accounts. This is what must be grabbed by the extension and used by the queue.

Once published, I'll attach the link here so anyone can try it for themselves
